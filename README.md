# carPricePredictionUsingMachineLearning
it is a app that predict the prices of car using the kaggle dataset.I originally wrote this code for CarDekhoDataset where the task was to predicting the prices using the diffrent constraints it have predicting using 6 classes from cardeko dataset that is year,selling_price,km_driven,fuel,Seller_type and transmission_owner
I did my best to write a very generalised piece of machine Learning Model using the Scikit Learn Library Multi-class regression with use of many stochastic gradient descent  that will work on any of the said type of application with little modification.
I have also made a full notebook that is provided in that notebook
I have also doing good EDA by using various plotting libraries
I have got an good accuracy by using the randomForest for the regression
